Drum Game
This project is a web-based Drum Kit application that allows users to play drum sounds by clicking buttons or pressing corresponding keys on their keyboard. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and utilizes audio elements to simulate a virtual drum set. Each button on the screen is associated with a specific drum sound, such as toms, snare, crash, and kick, and is visually represented with drum-related images.

The user interface is designed with a modern aesthetic, incorporating the 'Arvo' font and a color scheme that contrasts dark backgrounds with bright, colorful elements. The buttons are styled to resemble drum pads, with images indicating the type of drum sound they produce. When a button is clicked or a key is pressed, the associated sound plays, and a visual animation highlights the button, enhancing the interactive experience.

To use the Drum Kit, open the index.html file in a web browser. The JavaScript logic in index.js adds event listeners to the buttons and the document to detect both click and keypress events, triggering the makeSound and buttonAnimation functions. The sound files are stored in the sounds directory, and the button images are located in the images directory. This project is a fun way to explore web development techniques involving event handling, DOM manipulation, and multimedia integration and provides an engaging experience for users to explore their musical creativity.
